Page_0: "4.30 am, I'm awake again, singing to the dark through open eyes. While dreaming I see only you and me, stuck between desire and compromise. If I said I want you back I'd be a liar. There's nothing left for us to long for anymore. But inside the ashes burns an endless fire and every night I can't help reaching out for more. And I can't sleep, you're so far away from me and I can't sleep and I can't sleep. You're leaving me scars scattered in my heart, a road map of all the places you have been, and I can't escape, can't wash this away when love has burned your mark so deep within...
Piosenka 'Can´t Sleep' autorstwa Above & Beyond from the album 'Tri-State'."
