Page_0: "Get back, back to you, thats where I go when I'm so fed up, when I can't go on, in your arms, that's home to me. When I'm awfully tired, when I need love, and I need love...and I need love. It's 3am and I can hear you breathing, though I'm fast asleep, though I'm deeply dreaming, in your arms, that's home to me. When I'm awfully tired, when I need love... back to you. 
Piosenka 'Get Back' autorstwa Paula Van Dyka."
