Page_0: "Greetings Garrett. Did you enjoy the nap? I assume that by now you are missing something really important. You see, my boys found a tasty girl wandering alone in the streets. This girl is very similar to the one that entered this city with you. I'm sure she was pleasant company in bed! Ha ha ha. You should know that some walls don't only have ears but eyes as well. My boys have been observing you and your girlfriend ever since you stepped foot in this city. In case you don´t know, you've just entered in a dangerous place, especially for the likes of you, who are an unacceptable competition to our Assassins' Guild. We normally eliminate every thief that dares to enter our city"
Page_1: "but since I'm feeling nice today I decided that you and your girlfriend may survive...ahhh, but with one condition. I am in need of your well-known skills. Do what I ask and you will come out of this nasty situation alive and with your girlfriend back. I wouldn't recommend calling the authorities. After all, you wouldn't like me to tell the Mechanists about the nature of your relationship with this girl...what's her name? Ahhh yes, Anna! A fancy name she has. You should also know that some guards in this town may recognize you as a wanted thief so you'd be well advised to keep a low profile this night. Here's what I need you to do for me:"
Page_2: "Go to the Bocage bookstore in Muses square and find a book called (Things You Should Know About the Shadows that Stalk You). This book was written by the owner of the bookstore. He plans to publish it and I cannot allow that because this would bring unwanted publicity to our guild and yours as well. So get that book. Once you have it, turn off the lamps outside the bookstore so my informers will know you did the job. Then proceed to the Lucindinha Tavern in Alamacave street. Go inside the tavern and search for a yellow key in one of the open toilets. Now secondly, I need you to go to a store in Olaria street called Sobrenatural Alchemy."
Page_3: "Behind the counter you will find a green potion called Elixir of Dexterity. The owner keeps it safe for a generous customer. It's the only potion available in that store and I want to be sure it falls into my hands. Once you have it, steal one of the items displayed in the front window, just a signal to my informers so they'll know you did the job. Then go to Espirito Santo street and enter the Bodeguita pub. Look for a white key on one of the tables. And now for the last but not least. Today, a guy called Fureta won a good sum of money in a poker game. By now he should be at home listening to music as usual. You will find his home in Cardoso Avelino street."
Page_4: "It's easy to find. You only need to follow the music. It shouldn't be difficult to find his money inside the house. Once you have it, turn off Fureta's victrola and one of my boys will open the front door of a beige house in the same street. Inside this house you´ll find a blue key on a table - get it. Once you have these 3 keys you can pay me a visit and bring my presents. Go to Ponte street and head to the left, blue, brick building and use the 3 keys in the 3 locks to open the front door. I will be waiting inside for you with your girlfriend. Don't take too long Garrett because my boys are getting excited by the presence of your beautiful girlfriend and I'm not sure how long I can control them."
Page_5: "Oh, one more thing. I left you a map below your bed. It shows you the places where you must go to fulfill your tasks.
 
X, przywódca Gildii Zabójców."
