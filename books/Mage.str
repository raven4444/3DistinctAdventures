The waters are polluted with nocive quimics that have been destroying the waterlife. The air has also been poisoned with deadly emissions, which have prevented the flying creatures from doing their annual migrations. Our land is no longer fertile, has become a radioactive wasteland. This is a result of killing all the creatures and vegetation responsible for keeping the soil alive. Nothing has been done to prevent this from happening. Only now that our planet reacts aggressively to these incidents,  "

We've been having earthquakes, hurricanes, tsunamis, turmoils, floods, draws, avalanches, earthmovers, burning and freezing temperatures...you name it! Millions of people are dying every day thanks to these deadly manifestations and we see no end to this. The Gods are really angry with us. Not even the Talismans can heal the Planet quickly enough. We have no other option than to leave this Planet and seek a new place to live. For some time now, we Mages have known of a not very distant Planet called Earth.

We shall start a new life among them and teach them our language, culture and science and we shall only use archaic technology. We must not in any way let history repeat itself. The Supreme Mage has come to a final decision. We shall leave this planet tomorrow in our spaceships and take as many people as possible, as well as a two of each breed of living creature. I have already prepared my goods to take with me on this trip to Earth. Also, I and other Mages were in charge of taking the Air Talisman and placing it in the outpost orbiting our planet."

The Supreme Mage wants to make sure our Caprica is protected from unwanted aliens. Caprica will be left alone with only a few living beings for a few centuries to allow the planet to heal itself and recover from our nocive actions. It is our hope that future generations can return to a new, healthy and peaceful Caprica. Before those new generations can come home, they must place the Air Talisman near the other talismans in the Temple of the Gods to restore the planet's balance."
