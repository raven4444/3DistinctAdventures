Oh there's something there in the back of my mind haunting me, pulling me down. Going round on empty, from the sense you made to me, oh what a fool. It's come around again, I'm falling to the sound of my heart in pieces. The feeling's just the same, when love is ending, there is nothing like this pain.
Piosenka 'Come Around Again' autorstwa Signum feat Anita Kelsey."
