Page_0: "Counting out the hours, like the beat of a song, I feel like a stranger wondering where I belong. I wanna start all over but I know that I can't, I'm helpless without you, I don't know who I am, I'm under your spell, bound and blind and only you can save me. I'm tangled up inside, caught in your web, I'm hypnotized and only you can wake me, only you can bring this heart to life. Colors feel so faded, and I can't hear a sound, I'm walking in circles, watching my world burn down. There's nothing else to fight for cuz you're all that I know. I'm stuck in your shadow, letting you take control, I'm under your spell, bound and blind and only you can save me. I'm tangled up inside, caught in your web, I'm hypnotized and only you can wake me, only you can bring this heart to life. So pull me in and don't let go, I wanna fall forever, I wanna overflow. If there's some way out don't let me know,"
Page_1: "I don't wanna come to, it's too big to undo, I need to be near you, I can't keep away… Under your spell, I'm under your spell, bound and blind and only you can save me. I'm tangled up inside, caught in your web, I'm hypnotized and only you can wake me, only you can bring this heart to life.
