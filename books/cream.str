She's a living dream but she isn't what she seems, cause she's salty as the sea but she's sweeter than peaches and cream. Now her dress falls on the floor, as she slowly looks my way, then with a smile she says, I'll do anything you want me to today. She's a living dream but she isn't what she seems, cause she's salty as the sea but she's sweeter than peaches and cream.
Piosenka 'Peaches & Cream' autorstwa Markus Schulz."
